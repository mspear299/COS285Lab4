### Write up ###

We're still having issues pushing things to Github without overriding anything, however, I think with time we'll get better at this. The lab implements a function that prints the nodes in the order they're encountered. The lab also implements a find function that returns true or false if an inputed value is part of the tree. 

Compile the Java files by navigating to the correct directory and using the command line 'java -cp bin lab4.Lab4 data.txt'
## Example: 
user@user-Device lab4 % java -cp bin lab4.Lab4 data.txt
